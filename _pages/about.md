My name is Giorgio Nicoletti and I am currently a Ph.D. student in Physics at the University of Padova, Italy. I obtained both my BSc and my MSc in Physics at the University of Padova, and I spent a semester as an Erasmus student at the International Master in the Physics of Complex System in Paris, at Paris-Sud, Sorbonne Université and Paris-Diderot.

 I am working in the [Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics](https://liphlab.com/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> under the supervision of Amos Maritan and Samir Suweis. My current main research interest is the physics of phase transitions and critical systems and its relation to interdisciplinary settings.

 I am fascinated by the possibilities that tools and concepts from Statistical Mechanics open up in different fields, with a particular attention to Neuroscience for which I am collaborating with the [Padova Neuroscience Center](https://pnc.unipd.it/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->. I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the [Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems](https://www.pks.mpg.de/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> in Dresden, Germany, under the supervision of Daniel M. Busiello, and at the University of Tübingen, working in the [Self-organization and optimality in neuronal networks](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/self-organization-and-optimality-in-neuronal-networks/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> group under the supervision of Anna Levina.

I was awarded the [Graduate Alumni Award](https://www.alumniunipd.it/blog/event/alumni-awards-2022-storie-di-eccellenza/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> from the University of Padova for the best graduate student in the School of Science.
