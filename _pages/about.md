My name is Giorgio Nicoletti and I am currently a Ph.D. student in Physics at the University of Padova, Italy. I obtained both my BSc and my MSc in Physics at the University of Padova, and I spent a semester as an Erasmus student at the International Master in the Physics of Complex System in Paris, at Paris-Sud, Sorbonne Universit√© and Paris-Diderot.

 I am working in the [Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics](https://liphlab.com/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> under the supervision of Amos Maritan and Samir Suweis. My current main research interest is the physics of phase transitions and critical systems and its relation to interdisciplinary settings.

 I am fascinated by the possibilities that tools and concepts from Statistical Mechanics open up in different fields, with a particular attention to Neuroscience for which I am collaborating with the [Padova Neuroscience Center](https://pnc.unipd.it/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.
