My name is Giorgio Nicoletti and I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [ECHO lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/echo/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland. I am working on developing general metapopulation models in arbitrary network topologies under the supervision of Andrea Rinaldo.

I obtained my PhD in Physics cum laude at the [Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics](https://liphlab.com/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> under the supervision of Amos Maritan and Samir Suweis, with a particular focus on how the physics of phase transition and critical systems can be applied to the study of biological systems. With Daniel M. Busiello (MPIPKS, Germany) and many other collaborators, I am also currently working on understanding how biological systems process information and how they adapt to their environment, seeking universal principles that can be applied across different scales.

I am fascinated by the possibilities that tools and concepts from Statistical Mechanics open up in interdisciplinary fields, with particular attention to Neuroscience. I have been affiliated with the [Padova Neuroscience Center](https://pnc.unipd.it/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->, and I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the [Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems](https://www.pks.mpg.de/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> in Dresden, Germany, under the supervision of Daniel M. Busiello, and at the University of Tübingen, working in the [Self-organization and optimality in neuronal networks](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/self-organization-and-optimality-in-neuronal-networks/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> group under the supervision of Anna Levina.

I was awarded the [Graduate Alumni Award](https://www.alumniunipd.it/blog/event/alumni-awards-2022-storie-di-eccellenza/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> from the University of Padova for the best graduate student in the School of Science, and a grant from the [Department of Mathematics "Tullio Levi-Civita"](https://https://www.math.unipd.it/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> of the University of Padova to work in the project "Mathematical models for complex living systems: critical emergent phenomena from network interaction and optimization".
