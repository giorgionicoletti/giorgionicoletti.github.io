I'm Giorgio Nicoletti, a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [ECHO lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/echo/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland.

I am a theoretical physicist working at the interface between statistical physics, biology, and ecology. I obtained my PhD in Physics cum laude at the [Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics](https://liphlab.com/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> at the University of Padova under the supervision of Amos Maritan and Samir Suweis, with a particular focus on how the physics of phase transition and critical systems can be applied to the study of biological systems.

I was awarded the [Graduate Alumni Award](https://www.alumniunipd.it/blog/event/alumni-awards-2022-storie-di-eccellenza/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> from the University of Padova for the best graduate student in the School of Science. I was an affiliate of the [Padova Neuroscience Center](https://pnc.unipd.it/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->, a visiting Ph.D. student at the [Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems](https://www.pks.mpg.de/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->, and at the [AI center of the University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/self-organization-and-optimality-in-neuronal-networks/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.


## My work at a glance
My main project with Andrea Rinaldo (EPFL) and Amos Maritan (University of Padova) is the study of <span style="color:#6c757d;font-weight:600;">spatial metapopulation models</span> in arbitrary network topologies to understand how dispersal affects <span style="color:#6c757d;font-weight:600;">survival, coexistence and dynamics of ecological metacommunities</span>.

With Daniel M. Busiello (MPIPKS, Germany) and many other collaborators, I am also currently working on understanding <span style="color:#6c757d;font-weight:600;">how biological systems process information</span> and how they adapt to their environment, seeking universal principles that can be applied across different scales.
