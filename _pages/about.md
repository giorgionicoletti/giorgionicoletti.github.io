I'm Giorgio Nicoletti, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Quantitative Life Sciences section of UNESCO's [International Center for Theoretical Pysics](https://www.ictp.it/qls){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->, a research center supported by the IAEA and the United Nations, located in Trieste, Italy.

I am a theoretical physicist working at the interface between statistical physics, biology, and ecology. I obtained my PhD in Physics cum laude at the [Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics](https://liphlab.com/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> of the University of Padova (Italy) under the supervision of Amos Maritan and Samir Suweis, with a particular focus on how the physics of phase transition and critical systems can be applied to the study of living systems. I then moved to the [ECHO lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/echo/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> of the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland) for a postdoc with Andrea Rinaldo.

I was awarded the [Graduate Alumni Award](https://www.alumniunipd.it/blog/event/alumni-awards-2022-storie-di-eccellenza/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> from the University of Padova for the best graduate student in the School of Science. I have been an affiliate of the [Padova Neuroscience Center](https://pnc.unipd.it/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->, in Italy, and a visiting PhD student at the [AI center of the University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/self-organization-and-optimality-in-neuronal-networks/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->, in Germany. I was hosted several times at the [Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems](https://www.pks.mpg.de/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> in Dresden, Germany, as a visiting scientist. I have been a member of the Complex System Society, of the Italian Society of Physics, of the Italian Society of Statistical Physics, and the American Physical Society.

## My work at a glance
My main research interest is the Statistical Physics of Complex Systems and its theoretical and multidisciplinary applications, from Neuroscience to Ecology. With Antonio Celani (ICTP, Italy), Daniel M. Busiello (MPIPKS, Germany) and many other collaborators, I am currently working on the understanding <span style="color:#6c757d;font-weight:600;">how biological and artificial agents process information and make decisions</span> in complex and stochastic environments. We are seeking universal principles that can be applied across different scales, from biochemical to neural networks, exploiting ideas from Information Theory and general tools from machine learning.

With Amos Maritan (University of Padova), Andrea Rinaldo (EPFL) and Prajwal Padmanabha (University of Lausanne) I am also studying <span style="color:#6c757d;font-weight:600;">spatial metapopulation models</span> through the lenses of Statistical Physics. By studying ecological systems in arbitrary network topologies, we seek to understand how dispersal affects <span style="color:#6c757d;font-weight:600;">survival, coexistence and dynamics of ecological metacommunities</span>.

<!-- My works have been published in Physical Review X, Physical Review Letters, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), and Science Advances, among others. I have presented my work at several international conferences and workshops, -->
