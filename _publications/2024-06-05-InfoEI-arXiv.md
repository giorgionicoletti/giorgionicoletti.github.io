## Abstract
Understanding how the complex connectivity structure of the brain shapes its information-processing capabilities is a long-standing question. Here, by focusing on a paradigmatic architecture, we study how the neural activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations encodes information on external signals. We show that information is maximized at the edge of stability, where excitation is balanced by inhibition. When the input switches among different stimuli, this maximum corresponds to the entropy of the external switching dynamics. By analyzing the case of a prolonged stimulus, we find that stronger inhibition is needed to maximize the instantaneous sensitivity, revealing an intrinsic trade-off between short-time responses and long-time accuracy. In agreement with recent experimental findings, our results open the avenue for a complete information-theoretic understanding of how and why inhibition strength should be tuned to optimize information-processing capabilities.
