## Abstract
Biological and living systems process information across spatiotemporal scales, exhibiting the hallmark ability to constantly modulate their behavior to ever-changing and complex environments. In the presence of repeated stimuli, a distinctive response is the progressive reduction of the activity at both sensory and molecular levels, known as habituation. Here, we solve a minimal microscopic model devoid of biological details to show that habituation is driven by negative feedback provided by a slow storage mechanism. Crucially, an intermediate level of habituation is associated with a steep increase in the information that the system collects on the external input over time. We find that the region characterized both by maximal information gain and by the onset of habituation can be retrieved if the system tunes its parameters to minimize dissipation and maximize information at the same time. We test our dynamical predictions against experimentally recorded neural responses in a zebrafish larva subjected to repeated looming stimulation. Our work makes a fundamental step towards uncovering the core mechanisms that shape habituation in biological systems, elucidating its information-theoretic and functional role.
