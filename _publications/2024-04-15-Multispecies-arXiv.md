## Abstract
Metapopulation models have been instrumental in demonstrating the ecological impact of landscape structure on the survival of a focal species in complex environments. However, extensions to multiple species with arbitrary dispersal networks often rely on phenomenological assumptions limiting their scope. Here, we develop a multilayer network model of competitive dispersing metacommunities to investigate how spatially structured environments impact species coexistence and ecosystem stability. We show that homogeneous environments always lead to monodominance unless all species' fitness parameters are in an exact trade-off. However, this precise fine-tuning does not guarantee coexistence in generic heterogeneous environments. By introducing general spatial disorder in the model, we solve it exactly in the mean-field limit, finding that stable coexistence becomes possible in the presence of strong disorder. Crucially, coexistence is supported by the spontaneous localization of species through the emergence of ecological niches. Our results remain qualitatively valid in arbitrary dispersal networks, where topological features can improve species coexistence. Finally, we employ our model to study how correlated disorder promotes spatial ecological patterns in realistic terrestrial and riverine landscapes. Our work provides a novel framework to understand how landscape structure enables coexistence in metacommunities by acting as the substrate for ecological interactions.
