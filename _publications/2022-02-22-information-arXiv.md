## Abstract
Low-dimensional representations of underdamped systems often provide insightful grasps and analytical tractability. Here, we build such representations via information projections, obtaining an optimal model that captures the most information on observed spatial trajectories. We show that, in paradigmatic systems, the minimization of the information loss drives the appearance of a discontinuous transition in the optimal model parameters. Our results raise serious warnings for general inference approaches and unravel fundamental properties of effective dynamical representations, impacting several fields, from biophysics to dimensionality reduction.
