## Abstract
Bushfires are an intrinsic part of Australia's landscape, and its natural ecosystems have evolved to coexist with them. However, between 2019 and 2020, during the country's hottest and driest year on record, Australia experienced a dramatic bushfire season, with catastrophic ecological and environmental consequences. Several studies highlighted how such abrupt changes in fire regimes, in terms of size and spreading, may have been in large part a consequence of climate change and other anthropogenic transformations. In this work, we analyze the monthly evolution of the burned area in Australia from 2000 to 2020, obtained via satellite imaging through the MODIS platform. We find that the 2019-2020 peak of the burned area, the highest of the historical data, is associated with signatures that are typically found near tipping and critical points. We introduce a modeling framework based on forest-fire models to study these emergent fire outbreaks properties, showing that the behavior observed during the 2019-2020 fire season matches the one of a percolation transition, where system-size outbreaks appear. Our model also highlights that a second type of critical point might be crossed, after which the vegetation cannot significantly recover anymore.
